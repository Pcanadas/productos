# Desktop app for product management

This is a small desktop application for product management. This application uses Python3 and uses the Tkinter library.

The name, price, stock, and category of the product are recorded, and any of the products can be edited or deleted.

Notice: This project was started while I was learning Python 3 and the Tkinter library. The purpose of this project is purely to give me the opportunity to learn how to code and design a web system and eventually experience the challenges that a full stack developer might face in their daily work.

## Built with :nut_and_bolt:
- Python - Lenguaje de programación
- Tkinter - Library
- SQLite - Base de datos

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a working copy of the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
See the installation instructions for notes on how to deploy the project to a live system.

## Prerequisites
Below you will find what I use to develop and run the project

 - Python 3
 - Tkinter
 - SQLite database
 - Virtualenv (not required, but highly recommended)

## Installation
I use Virtualenv to develop this project, so I recommend you create a virtual environment virtualenv venv and install the requirements <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code><br>
Then, get a local copy of the project directory by cloning "tasks" from github. <br>
Lastly, run <code>python main.py</code>
